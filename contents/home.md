## 👤 About Me

I am a Ph.D. candidate in Mathematics at the School of Mathematics, Southeast University. My research centers on inverse problems and medical imaging, with a focus on electrical impedance tomography (EIT) and acousto-electric tomography (AET). I am particularly interested in developing stable, interpretable, and practically applicable imaging and reconstruction methods that enhance robustness in complex media and real-world measurement scenarios.
